# Ingrediants
* 8 pieces of bacon or 4 pieces of Canadian bacon
* 2 tablespoons chopped parsley, for garnish
* 4 eggs
* 2 teaspoons white or rice vinegar
* 2 English muffins
* Butter

#### Blender Hollandaise

* 10 tablespoons unsalted butter (if using salted butter, omit the added salt)
* 3 egg yolks
* 1 tablespoon lemon juice
* 1/2 teaspoon salt

# Methods

### Cooking the Bacon
Heat a large pan or skillet on medium-low heat. Add your choice of bacon. Slowly fry the pieces, turning over occasionally, until brown on both sides. If using strips, see that much of the fat is renedered out (about 10 minutes).

Use tongs or a fork to remove the bacon from the pan, set on a paper towel to absorb the excess fat.

Don't pour the bacon fat left in the pan down the drain! Either sop it up with paper towels when it has cooled a bit, or pour it into a jar to be used later (see rendering bacon fat).
