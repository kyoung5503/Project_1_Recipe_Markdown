# Methods

## Cooking the Bacon
Heat a large pan or skillet on medium-low heat. Add your choice of bacon. Slowly fry the pieces, turning over occasionally, until brown on both sides. If using strips, see that much of the fat is renedered out (about 10 minutes).

Use tongs or a fork to remove the bacon from the pan, set on a paper towel to absorb the excess fat.

Don't pour the bacon fat left in the pan down the drain! Either sop it up with paper towels when it has cooled a bit, or pour it into a jar to be used later.

## Poaching the Egg
### Bring poaching water to a simmer: 
While the bacon is cooking, bring a large saucepan two-thirds-filled with water to a boil, then add the vinegar. Bring the water to a boil again, then lower the heat to a bare simmer.

### Poach the eggs
 Here is an easy method for poaching eggs. Essentially, working one egg at a time you crack an egg into a small bowl and slip it into the barely simmering water. Once it begins to solidify, you can slip in another egg, until you have all four cooking.
 
 Turn off the heat, cover the pan, and let sit for 4 minutes. (Remember which egg went in first, you'll want to take it out first.) When it comes time to remove the eggs, gently lift out with a slotted spoon.
 
 Note that the timing is a little variable on the eggs, depending on the size of your pan, how much water, how many eggs, and how runny you like them. You might have to experiment a little with your set-up to figure out what you need to do to get the eggs exactly the way you like them.

## Make Hollandaise sauce
 To make blender hollandaise, melt 10 Tbsp unsalted butter.

 Put 3 egg yolks, a tablespoon of lemon juice, 1/2 teaspoon salt in a blender, blend on medium to medium high speed for 20-30 seconds, until eggs lighten in color.

 Turn blender down to lowest setting, slowly dribble in the hot melted butter, while continuing to blend. Taste for salt and acidity and add more salt or lemon juice to taste.

 Transfer it to a container you can use for pouring and set it on a warm—but not hot—place on or near the stovetop.

## Preparing The English Muffins
As soon as all the eggs are in the poaching water, begin toasting your English muffins. If you can’t get all the muffins toasted by the time the eggs are ready, gently remove the eggs from the poaching water and set in a bowl.

## Final Assembly
To assemble, butter one side of an English muffin. Top with two slices of bacon or 1 slice of Canadian bacon. You can trim the bacon to fit the muffin if you’d like.

Put a poached egg on top of the bacon, then pour some hollandaise over. Sprinkle some parsley over it all and serve at once.


## Notes
You could sub out the english muffins for whole wheat is you please to;
You could also put a dash of hot sauce for a little spice
